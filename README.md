## Section 1: General Info

Simulate your own management company to manage properties to be built for rent, and charges are used for a management fee from the percentage of the monthly amount. The properties cannot overlap each other, properties have to be at a limit within size, and the maximum amount of properties handled by the company is 5.

## Section 3: Behind the Scenes

Going through the ".html" files step by step was pretty confusing except setting up the objects and methods, reading some descriptions require coding, the overlap method took a lot of effort to set up for the GUI file to be programmed the way the programmer expects. Uploading pictures on Eclipse is another step that took me a while; making a new folder in the “src” folder is a requirement inside the Eclipse program itself, I thought you’d have to submit your folder path, but you have to leave the code as it is. Making a test run wasn’t easy, to begin with, because you’ll have to plan some ideas before testing the program, and many times I like to be creative based on my hobbies, childhood, etc. When I tested the “No GUI” file, the String sentences share the same outcome like the “GUI” file, but I went back through the “ManagementCompany” file with some tweaks to make the console and GUI outputs look the way I want it to look like.
